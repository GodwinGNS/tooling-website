In a previous project, “Implementing a Three-Tier Web Solution with WordPress”, I implemented a WordPress-based solution that is now ready to be used as a fully functional website or blog. In this project, I will be adding more value to this solution by implementing a tooling website solution that makes access to DevOps tools within the corporate infrastructure easily accessible.

In this project, you will implement a solution that consists of the following components:

Infrastructure: AWS
Webserver Linux: Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8
Database Server: Ubuntu 20.04 + MySQL
Storage Server: Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 + NFS Server
Programming Language: PHP
GitHub Code Repository.
Prerequisites

Knowledge of AWS core services and CLI
Basic knowledge of Linux commands and how to manage storage on a Linux server.
Basic knowledge of Network-attached storage (NAS), Storage Area Networks (SAN), and related protocols like NFS, FPT, SFTP, SMB, iSCSI.
Knowledge of Block-level storage and how it is used on the Cloud.
Architecture

We will be implementing a solution that comprises multiple web servers sharing a common database and also accessing the same files using Network File System (NFS) as shared file storage.....
